# Bertelsmann-Arvato-Project

1. Libraries used in the notebook:
* Pandas
* Numpys
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Xgboost

2. Project Overview:

  Arvato Financial Service is a mail order company in Germany. We are expected to use unsupervised learning method to report the customer segmentation. Also, supervised machine learning is applied to predict on whether the compaign targets would become the company's customers. Before we perform the learning methods, necessary data cleaning and trandormation are implemented for the requirements of machine learning.
 

3. Files inlcuded
* Arvato Project: a python jupyter notebook that performed data cleaning and machine learning methods. 
* A report of the project can be found at [https://medium.com/p/283139054b73/]

4. Concluison:

 Using PCA and Kmeans we managed to make clusters for general population and customers. And we have following conclusions of customers segmentation:
* They are in good social status and fine lifestage.
* They have cars that are good brands or with supreme attributes.
* People who have higher online affinity are likely to be customers.
* People who have financial typology of 'be prepared' or 'money saver' are more possible to be the customers than other typologies.

For supervised learning, we built a classification model via XGboost and have a final RUCAOC score of 0.753.
